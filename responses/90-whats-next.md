Congratulations, @{{ user.username }}, you've finished the course! :sparkles:

Now that you're on or working with the USGS Data Science team, you'll likely be using data pipelines like the one you explored here in your visualization and analysis projects. More questions will surely come up - when they do, you have some options:

1. Visit the [targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) documentation pages and [The targets R Package User Manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/)
1. If you're a member of the IIDD Data Science Branch, ask questions and share ideas in our *Function - Data Pipelines* Teams channel. If you're not a member, you are likely taking this course because you are working with someone who is. Reach out to them with questions/ideas.

<hr><h3 align="center">You rock, @{{ user.username }}! Time for a well-deserved break.</h3>
