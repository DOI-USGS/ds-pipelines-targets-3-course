It's time to meet the data analysis challenge for this course! Over the next series of issues, you'll connect with the [USGS National Water Information System (NWIS)](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis) web service to learn about some of the longest-running monitoring stations in USGS streamgaging history.

The repository is already set up with a basic **scipiper** data pipeline that:
* Queries NWIS to find the oldest discharge gage in each of three Upper Midwest states
* Maps the state-winner gages
