### :keyboard: Activity: Spot the split-apply-combine (again)

- [ ] Check out the code for `tally_site_obs()`. To strengthen your familiarity with the *split-apply-combine* paradigm, can you isolate the *split*, *apply*, and *combine* operations within this **tidyverse** expression?
```r
site_data %>%
  mutate(Year = lubridate::year(Date)) %>%
  # group by Site and State just to retain those columns, since we're already only looking at just one site worth of data
  group_by(Site, State, Year) %>%
  summarize(NumObs = length(which(!is.na(Value))))
```
