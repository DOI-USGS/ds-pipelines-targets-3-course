### :keyboard: Activity: Test your splitter's power

You have a fancy new splitter, but you still need to see the benefits in action.

#### Test

- [ ] Call `tar_make()` one more time. Nothing should rebuild.

- [ ] Add Indiana (`IN`) and Iowa (`IA`) to the vector of `states` in *_targets.R*. Rebuild. Did you see the rebuilds and non-rebuilds that you expected?

(If you're not sure what you should have expected, check with your course contact, or another teammate.)

#### Commit and PR

Comfortable with your pipeline's behavior? Time for a PR!

- [ ] Commit your changes to *1_fetch/src/get_site_data.R*, and *_targets.R*. Use `git push` to push your change up to the "splitter" branch on GitHub.

When everything is committed and pushed, create a pull request on GitHub. In your PR description note which targets got built when you added `IN` and `IA` to `states`.
